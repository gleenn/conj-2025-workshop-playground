;; ;; (clay/make! {:single-form '(str "hello," " world!")})

;; ;; And we'll want to roll these request counts up by some cadence. Let's try
;; ;; monthly by year. To do that we roll up date around the first day of each

;; ;; Let's first build a function that can convert time that way
;; (defn ->first-day-of_month [datestr]
;;   (jt/adjust
;;    (jt/local-date src-fmt datestr)
;;    :first-day-of-month))

;; (-> workshop-data

;;     first
;;     ->first-day-of_month)

;;        (-> row
;;            :REQUEST_TYPE
;;            top-five-requests)))

;;     (tc/add-column
;;      :FIRST_DAY_OF_MONTH
;;      (fn [ds]
;;        (map ->first-day-of_month (:RECEIVED_DATE ds))))
;;     ;; then we can do our grouping
;;     (tc/group-by [:REQUEST_TYPE :FIRST_DAY_OF_MONTH])
;;     (tc/aggregate {:COUNT tc/row-count}))

;; ;; now we can plot but let's package this data up
;; (def year-month-data

;;              :REQUEST_TYPE

;;       (tc/order-by :FIRST_DAY_OF_MONTH)))

;; ;; Now let's plot it using tableplot + plotly. We'll try the layer-line function
;; ;; first
;; (-> year-month-data
;;     #_(tc/order-by :FIRST_DAY_OF_MONTH)
;;     (plotly/layer-line
;;      {:=x :FIRST_DAY_OF_MONTH
;;       :=color :REQUEST_TYPE
;;       :=y :COUNT}))

;; ;; Still maybe we can improve the formatting a bit, move the legend
